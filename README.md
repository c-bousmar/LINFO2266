## UCLouvain LINFO2266 - Advanced Algorithms for Optimization

I worked on multiple projects applying different optimization techniques to solve combinatorial problems. Each project focused on a specific approach:  

- **MDD (Multi-valued Decision Diagrams):** Implemented a decision diagram-based method to model and solve discrete optimization problems efficiently by exploiting problem structure.  
- **Branch and Bound:** Developed an exact algorithm using bounding techniques to prune the search space and accelerate the resolution of combinatorial problems.  
- **Constraint Programming:** Formulated optimization problems as constraint satisfaction models, leveraging constraint propagation and search heuristics to find optimal solutions.  
- **Dynamic Programming:** Designed recursive and memoized solutions for optimization problems, efficiently solving subproblems and reusing computed values to reduce computational complexity.  
- **Linear Programming:** Modeled and solved problems using linear constraints and objective functions, employing solvers like Simplex or Interior Point methods.  
- **Local Search:** Implemented heuristic-based algorithms to explore solution spaces iteratively, improving solutions through neighborhood search techniques.  

Each project involved algorithm implementation, performance evaluation, and a comparative study of its advantages, limitations, and real-world applicability.
