\begin{Exercise}[title={Modeling the Traveling Salesman Problem}]

The Traveling Salesman Problem is a famous combinatorial optimization problem where a salesman has to find the shortest tour visiting all cities from a given set $N=\{1,\ldots,n\}$.
The salesman can travel between every pair of cities $i,j \in N$, which are separated by a distance $d_{ij}$.
Find a dynamic programming model for the Traveling Salesman Problem.

\Question What information is contained in the states of the model?

\begin{Exercise}[title={Experiments}]

\Question Create a table with the rune time for all the instances of size 8, 10 and 18 in the data/TSP directory. 
          This table must be generated by a new class with a main method in your repository.
	  Specify the characteristics the machine used for the experiment.

\Question Create a graphic with the number of instances solved over time, for instances of size 8, 10 and 18.
	  The x axis is the time, the y axis are the number of instances. (you may use log-scale axis for clarity).
	  The graphic can be created from the content of the data in the table.
